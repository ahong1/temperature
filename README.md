Simple Thermometer React App - Alfred Hong

This Thermometer reads an array of objects that contains the temperature and it's units (celsius or fahrenheit). The thermometer will check if the temperature has crossed a freezing or boiling threshold that the user sets and will be logged into the text area. The user can choose to ignore temperatures that are closely fluctuating, and can also choose to only log temperatures going from high to low or vice cersa. The user may change to display the units in celsius or fahrenheit.
